# Refactoring of Imperative Code

This directory contains a .dot file for creating a diagram of the algorithms
used to convert imperative code into a more functional style. This was composed
in order to develop an automated algorithm that could do the tedious work of
converting imperative Fortran code.

# TODO

1. Create a program that implements these algorithms.
2. Run it on the legacy chemsol code and see if it produces similar results
to what the updated code here contains
